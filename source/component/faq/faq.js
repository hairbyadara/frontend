        <h3>What is virgin hair?</h3>
        <p>Virgin hair extensions are 100% real human hair that hasn't been altered by a chemical process. Virgin hair is the highest quality human hair available on the market. Virgin human hair extensions means it is collected from donors whose hair has never been chemically processed (no perms, hair color etc) and comes from hair donors with long healthy hair. Virgin hair can last 1 to 2 years with proper care.</p>
        <h3>What is remy hair></h3>
        <p>Remy hair means that all the cuticles are intact, running in the same direction (at time of collection).  When all strands follow the same direction, there will be almost no tangling and matting (if processed properly). With true high quality remy hair, the hair collected is healthy, the cuticles intact and all cuticles flow in the same direction from root to the tip.</p>
